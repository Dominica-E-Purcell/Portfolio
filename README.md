# Portfolio>

## Description
My motivation for creating a portfolio was to a place where I can display my work to future employers. 
I wanted to give an impression of who I am as a person.
If and when I get to a place that I want it then this will allow potential collaborators and employers to get to know me and my work. This will also serve as a way to get in contact with me. 
That I don't know as much as I thought I did about flex.

## Play by play
-I did the HTML first and I felt pretty comfident about understanding when it came to sections and divs. However when it came to putting in the classes to make the card I became uncertain and made last minute changes to where classes were.
-I felt the best about media queries although I can't tell if the second on isn't working right because of messing up the class stuff or not. 
Overall this feels a bit messy and chaotic but I think that with a little bit of a review of the advanced CSS material I can figureout where I went wrong (Monday 6th 2023)

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
